Secure Internet Messenger

I wrote this when I was 16 as a Computer Science class final project for my hight school. Do not judge the code - I was young and new to Software Development. It was the first big project I have done.

### Technologies used

- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Node-Webkit(this version was remade with Electron)
- NodeJS on backend
- HTTPS and RSA for the data transmission encryption
